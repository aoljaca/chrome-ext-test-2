# chrome-ext-test-2

Does not work on all pages since it might mess up the html and disable links but a little alteration is ok

Makes reading more fun and easier

Practice on Wikipedia (my fav)

Highlights the words for you as you go along

Refresh page if not working 

Takes 5 seconds to load

To turn off go to manage chrome extensions here --> chrome://extensions/

Let me know if you would like different colors and or would like to contribute
